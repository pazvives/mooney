# Synthesis of Mooney Images through a Generative Approach

Read the full paper of this work in <TODO: upload>.

The 'src' folder contains the code that has been implemented to run the experiments explained in the paper. 
This folder also includes three notebooks to be used as examples of how to use/run the main contributions of this work, namely: (1) datasets, (2) autoencoder training and (3) optimization of latent space to generate Mooneys.

The 'models' folder contains the two best trained autoencoders generated from the experiments as described in the paper. Therefore, they can be taken as they are and used to generate Mooney images without any training.
